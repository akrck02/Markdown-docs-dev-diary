# Coding base abstractions

Just start using the abstractions shown in the intro.

## Tokenizer, AbstractTree and Block classes.

This classes are the core of parsing process, the milestone of the machine to machine intercomunication, so we, skilless programmers must code them with a attention. ü•∫

- I **started creating the Block class,** an abstraction of any type of text container **with a type, text and children.** Simple enough.
    
    

So, here it is: 

```tsx
export class Block {

    private text: string;
    private children: Block[];
    private type: string;

    constructor(text: string, type: string) {
        this.text = text;
        this.children = [];
        this.type = type;
    }  

    public getText(): string {
        return this.text;
    }

    public getChildren(): Block[] {
        return this.children;
    }

    public getType(): string {
        return this.type;
    }
    
}
```

The blocks will be the core of the library such us tiny little LEGO pieces. But that‚Äôs wrong, isn‚Äôt it? LEGO pieces don‚Äôt have other pieces inside of them, so we need a better metaphor here. That‚Äôs it, the matryoshka toys!

The matryoshka toys are stored inside other matryoshka toys some short or self type container. Our basic blocks lacks this type of structure so **I created the AbstractTree class representing that structure to follow.** 

```tsx
import { Block } from "./block";

export class AbstractTree {

    private children: Block[];
    
    constructor() {
        this.children = [];
    }

    public getChildren(): Block[] {
        return this.children;
    }

    public addChild(child: Block) {
        this.children.push(child);
    }

    public getChild(index: number): Block {
        return this.children[index];
    }
}
```

Okay, so we have blocks and a tree structure to organize them. The following step will be creating the Tokenizer, so we can create block from Markdown text.

```tsx
import { AbstractTree } from "./abstractTree";
import { Block } from "./block";
import { Delimiter } from "./delimiters/delimiter";

export class Tokenizer {
    
    private tree : AbstractTree;

    constructor() {
        this.tree = new AbstractTree();
    }

    /**
     * Get the abstract tree of the text to be translated. 
     * @param text The text to be translated.
     * @returns The abstract tree of the text to be translated.
     */
    public tokenize(text: string): AbstractTree {
        return this.tree;
    }

    /**
     * Tokenize a line of text.
     * @param line The line of text to be tokenized.
     * @returns The block of the line of text.
     */
    private tokenizeLine(line: string): Block {
        return undefined;
    }
}
```

Yes, we have some ‚Äúplaceholder‚Äù methods here, so let‚Äôs explain them.

### Tokenize(text : string)

This is the main method of the Tokenizer, the one in charge to get the blocks from the given text and fill our AbstractTree with them.

### TokenizeLine(line : string)

This one takes a line as an input, and get the blocks inside that particular line, returning a block with the resulting children.
